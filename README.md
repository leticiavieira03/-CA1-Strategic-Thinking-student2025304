# Predicting Customer Purchase Intentions  

## Introduction: 
         
 In recent years, the rapid growth of e-commerce has transformed how people buy products and services. This shift has created a new type of consumer: more demanding, connected, and seeking personalized experiences. With millions of users visiting online stores every day, companies are increasingly focused on understanding customer behaviour to improve marketing strategies and boost sales performance. 
Each online interaction — from pages visited to time spent browsing — generates valuable data that can reveal important behavioural patterns. By analysing this data, businesses can predict the likelihood of a customer completing a purchase and design more effective marketing campaigns. 
This project, “Predicting Customer Purchase Intentions in E-commerce Websites,” aims to apply data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict the probability of purchase based on user behaviour. The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing information about user sessions such as page views, bounce rates, and visitor types. The first phase of this Capstone Project focuses on data understanding and exploratory analysis, while the second phase will involve predictive model development and evaluation.

## Objectives: 
 
The main objective of the first phase of this Capstone Project is to explore and understand customer behavior data from e-commerce websites to identify the key factors that influence purchase intentions. 
This stage focuses on data exploration and preparation, forming the foundation for the predictive modelling. 
 
This assignment aims to explore the following objectives: 
 
### Review relevant literature on customer purchase behavior and predictive analytics in e-commerce 
  
### Collect, clean, and understand the dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
 
### Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify behavioral patterns and relationships between variables that may influence purchase decisions. 
 
### Summarize initial findings and highlight the main factors affecting customer purchase intentions. 
 
 
Problem Definition: 
 
This report aims to identify and analyze the key challenges related to understanding customer purchase behavior in e-commerce. 
The growing reliance on online shopping has generated vast amounts of user interaction data; however, many organizations fail to utilize this information effectively to understand customer intentions and improve marketing performance. As a result, businesses often struggle to predict which visitors are most likely to complete a purchase, leading to missed opportunities and inefficient use of marketing resources. 
Understanding this issue is crucial, as the ability to anticipate customer needs and behaviors provides a significant competitive advantage in the digital marketplace. This project will explore how data-driven analysis can help identify behavioral patterns that influence purchasing decisions. 
The challenges of this project include: 
Data quality and availability: ensuring the dataset contains sufficient, reliable, and representative information for meaningful analysis. 
Avoiding bias: maintaining objectivity in interpreting results and focusing strictly on factual data patterns. 
Scalability and applicability: ensuring that the insights obtained can be adapted to different e-commerce contexts. 
 
 
The context of the problem and the importance of this to be addressed are: 
 
The rapid growth of e-commerce has transformed how consumers interact with online stores. Companies now have access to large volumes of data generated by user interactions, such as page views, session duration, and visitor types. However, despite the availability of this data, many organizations struggle to interpret it effectively and understand customer purchasing behavior. 
Accurately identifying which users are likely to make a purchase is critical for improving marketing strategies, enhancing user experience, and increasing conversion rates. By analyzing behavioral data, companies can make data-driven decisions, optimize resource allocation, and gain a competitive advantage in the digital marketplace. 
Addressing this problem is essential, as it allows businesses to anticipate customer needs, design targeted marketing campaigns and maximize the efficiency of online sales strategies.  
 
## Scope: 
 
Over the first semester, the scope of the project is to explore the following topics and try to answer the following questions: 
 
###1 Customer Behavior Analysis: Which factors influence whether a visitor completes a purchase? How do variables such as page views, session duration, and visitor type affect purchase intentions? 
 
###2 Patterns in Online Shopping Data: What trends or patterns can be identified from the dataset? Are there specific behaviors that indicate a higher likelihood of purchase? 
 
 
Data Quality and Reliability: Are there missing, inconsistent, or biased data points that need to be addressed before further analysis? 
 
 
At the end of this first-semester phase, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, uncover preliminary insights about customer behavior, and establish a solid foundation for further predictive modeling in subsequent stages.
