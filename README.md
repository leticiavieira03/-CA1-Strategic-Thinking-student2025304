# Predicting Customer Purchase Intentions  

## Introduction: 
         
 In recent years, the rapid growth of e-commerce has transformed how people buy products and services. This shift has created a new type of consumer: more demanding, connected, and seeking personalized experiences. With millions of users visiting online stores every day, companies are increasingly focused on understanding customer behaviour to improve marketing strategies and boost sales performance. 
Each online interaction — from pages visited to time spent browsing — generates valuable data that can reveal important behavioural patterns. By analysing this data, businesses can predict the likelihood of a customer completing a purchase and design more effective marketing campaigns. 
This project, “Predicting Customer Purchase Intentions in E-commerce Websites,” aims to apply data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict the probability of purchase based on user behaviour. The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing information about user sessions such as page views, bounce rates, and visitor types. The first phase of this Capstone Project focuses on data understanding and exploratory analysis, while the second phase will involve predictive model development and evaluation.

## Business understanding 
 
In the e-commerce context, companies generate vast amounts of user interaction data, including page views, session duration, and visitor type. When properly analyzed, this information can reveal valuable patterns that indicate purchasing intentions. Understanding and predicting customer behavior is essential to improving marketing efficiency and enhancing the user experience. 
 
However, many organizations fail to fully utilize this data to anticipate customer actions, leading to missed sales opportunities and less effective marketing strategies. This project applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify behavioral patterns that influence purchase decisions. 
 
The findings aim to support strategic business thinking by providing insights that enable companies to design more personalized, efficient, and data-driven marketing approaches (Sakar and Kastro, 2018; Alizamir et al., 2022). 

## Objectives 
The main objective of the first phase of this Capstone Project is to explore and understand customer behavior data from e-commerce websites to identify the key factors influencing purchase intentions. This stage focuses on data exploration and preparation, establishing the foundation for predictive modeling and strategic business decision-making. 

This project aims to achieve the following specific objectives: 

Review relevant literature on customer purchase behavior and predictive analytics in e-commerce to provide theoretical support for the study. 
Collect, clean, and understand the dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, ensuring data quality and reliability. 
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify behavioral patterns and relationships between key variables that may influence purchase decisions. 
Summarize initial findings to highlight the main factors affecting customer purchase intentions and guide future predictive modeling. 
 
## Scope 

The project uses the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains 12,330 user sessions with 18 features, including numerical and categorical variables such as page views, bounce rate, visitor type, and weekend activity. This dataset provides sufficient information to explore customer behavior and predict purchase intentions. 
All analysis will follow the CRISP-DM methodology. The first semester focuses on data understanding, cleaning, and exploratory analysis, while the second semester will develop machine learning models to predict purchase probability and provide strategic insights for marketing.

## Methodology 
The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology to ensure a structured and reproducible approach: 
Business Understanding: Define objectives, understand the problem, and identify key behavioral questions regarding purchase intentions. 
Data Understanding and Preparation: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing or inconsistent values, and verify data quality.
