# Predicting Customer Purchase Intentions  

## Introduction: 
         
 In recent years, the rapid growth of e-commerce has transformed how people buy products and services. This shift has created a new type of consumer: more demanding, connected, and seeking personalized experiences. With millions of users visiting online stores every day, companies are increasingly focused on understanding customer behaviour to improve marketing strategies and boost sales performance. 
Each online interaction — from pages visited to time spent browsing — generates valuable data that can reveal important behavioural patterns. By analysing this data, businesses can predict the likelihood of a customer completing a purchase and design more effective marketing campaigns. 
This project, “Predicting Customer Purchase Intentions in E-commerce Websites,” aims to apply data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict the probability of purchase based on user behaviour. The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing information about user sessions such as page views, bounce rates, and visitor types. The first phase of this Capstone Project focuses on data understanding and exploratory analysis, while the second phase will involve predictive model development and evaluation.

## Objectives: 
 
The main objective of the first phase of this Capstone Project is to explore and understand customer behavior data from e-commerce websites to identify the key factors that influence purchase intentions. 
This stage focuses on data exploration and preparation, forming the foundation for the predictive modelling. 
 
This assignment aims to explore the following objectives: 
 
### Review relevant literature on customer purchase behavior and predictive analytics in e-commerce 
  
### Collect, clean, and understand the dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
 
### Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify behavioral patterns and relationships between variables that may influence purchase decisions. 
 
### Summarize initial findings and highlight the main factors affecting customer purchase intentions. 
 
## Scope 
The project uses the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains 12,330 user sessions with 18 features, including numerical and categorical variables such as page views, bounce rate, visitor type, and weekend activity. This dataset provides sufficient information to explore customer behavior and predict purchase intentions. 
All analysis will follow the CRISP-DM methodology. The first semester focuses on data understanding, cleaning, and exploratory analysis, while the second semester will develop machine learning models to predict purchase probability and provide strategic insights for marketing.
